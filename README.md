# Bridge Testing Simulation
The simulation and optimization of a crane boom truss in Matlab was the final project for MTE 219. For our design, we chose to optimize a warren bridge.

# Description
The bridge was to be made from a 4" by 12" basswood sheet and span over a 30 cm gap. One side of the bridge was fastened down while the other was under the load. The bridge and its members were modelled. The method used is called the direct method and was used to create a stiffness matrix, which includes the stress of each member. By Looking at these failure modes and strengthening members under a critical load we were able to increase the bridge's strength to weight ratio. All values that were used in the stress calculations were obtained from a lab analyzing the material properties of basswood.
